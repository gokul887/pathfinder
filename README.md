# React-Flask Pathfinding Algorithm Visualizer

Welcome to the React-Flask Pathfinding Algorithm Visualizer! This project allows you to visualize various pathfinding algorithms in action, leveraging the power of React for the frontend and Flask for the backend. Create custom walls and witness how algorithms navigate through them.

## Features

- **Algorithm Visualization**: Watch popular pathfinding algorithms like Dijkstra's, A*, and more in action.
- **Customizable Walls**: Designate custom walls on the grid to simulate real-world obstacles.
- **Responsive Interface**: Enjoy a seamless user experience with a responsive and interactive interface.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: Frontend library for building dynamic user interfaces.
- **Flask**: Backend framework for serving the frontend and handling API requests.
- **Pathfinding Algorithms**: Implementations of popular algorithms like Dijkstra's, A*, etc.
- **CSS Grid**: For creating a visually appealing grid-based layout.

## Installation

1. **Clone Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pathfinding-visualizer.git`.
2. **Install Dependencies**: Navigate to the project directory and install frontend dependencies using `npm install`.
3. **Run Frontend**: Start the frontend using `npm start`. The app will run on `localhost:3000` by default.
4. **Navigate to Flask Directory**: Move into the Flask directory with `cd flask-backend`.
5. **Install Flask Dependencies**: Install Flask dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
6. **Run Flask Backend**: Start the Flask backend with `python app.py`. The backend will run on `localhost:5000`.

## Usage

1. Open the application in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.
2. Visualize pathfinding algorithms by selecting an algorithm, adding custom walls, and clicking "Visualize!"
